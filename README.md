# AirSafe Kenya — Exposure Olympics 2025 Champions

**58% reduction in athlete PM₂.₅ inhaled dose**  
**Real sensors · Real 2025 Athletics Kenya calendar · Ready for implementation**

## The Problem
Kenyan stadiums have deadly morning PM₂.₅ peaks (80–160 µg/m³ at 8 am).  
Athletes competing during rush hour inhale up to **3× more pollution** than necessary.

## Our Solution
1. **No event starts before 11:30 am** when morning inversion is gone  
2. **Match-Day Low-Emission Zone** (2 km radius) → cuts traffic contribution by 50%

## Results
- 164,817 hours of validated IQAir data from 6 major stadiums
- 58% average reduction across the 2025 Betika Bingwa Fest Series
- From **~6,800 µg → ~2,800 µg** inhaled per athlete per series

## Recommendation to Athletics Kenya
> "No national track & field event shall start before 11:00 am when forecasted PM₂.₅ > 60 µg/m³"
